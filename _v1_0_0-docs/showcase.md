Now.ontotext.com is a showcase of Dynamic Semantic Publishing (DSP) Platform.

It both relies on metadata and produces rich metadata to еnable dynamic creation of custom content streams, content reuse and re-purposing, and user tailored recommendations.

All metadata is represented in RDF and it is stored in Ontotext GraphDB database. In NOW showcase, we have combined DBPedia 2015, WikiData, and GeoNames to create a high-coverage general purpose dataset, containing over 4 million People, Locations, Organizations, Animals, Plants and other Things.

Find out what is possible with [News on the Web (NOW)](http://now.ontotext.com) yourselves and share your thoughts. We’ve built NOW not only as a showcase for dynamic semantic publishing but also as a place where we will experiment with new features and approaches, and engage you as equal partners on the level of ideas and insights.
